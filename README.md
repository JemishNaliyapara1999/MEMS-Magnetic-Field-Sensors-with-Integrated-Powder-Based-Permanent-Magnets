# MEMS-Magnetic-Field-Sensors-with-Integrated-Powder-Based-Permanent-Magnets
• Designed a MEMS-based magnetic field sensor using COMSOL Multi-Physics software.

• Conducted theoretical analysis of the magnetic field sensitivity of the sensor based on the notion of torque
experienced by the cantilever beam
